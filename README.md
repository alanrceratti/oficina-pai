## About The Project

This is a simple web-site developed for a car mechanic business in Brazil.

The site allows the customer to check the services provided by the business, hours of opening and getting in touch through the contact form which can serve as a way of booking the desire service.

It has the main focus in mobile users and it's css was coded first for mobile and then media queries were made for other devices. A personalized mobile menu with a nice animation when opened also gives a special touch to the web-site.
